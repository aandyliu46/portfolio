# Additional Enhancements:
# I removed the contact forms. If someone were to look at my site, the traffic would be coming from LinkedIn or an internal database with candidates, so a contact form is unnecessary and clunky. It just makes more sense for someone to connect with me on LinkedIn or email.
# As far as other enhancements, I fixed my site so that its rid of spelling errors. Im expanding on the actual content of my site, as well as pruning random elements so that the site has a cleaner look u can check my old deployment here and compare, i think its a pretty major difference https://beautiful-kelpie-a40956.netlify.app/
# in addition, i made the navbar better looking. I also changed the theme toggle button so that its an image. It makes it a little harder to detect that its a button, but light and dark mode is a bit unneeded in my opinion. Instead, its now a one piece reference. If you watch the show it would make alot of sense, and might really connect with a recruiter who enjoys the show. Its pretty main stream media, so if a recruiter notices it might give me some brownie points, which a regular theme toggle button is unlikely to do.
