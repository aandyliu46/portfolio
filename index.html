        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Andy Liu, a senior at UC San Diego. I study mathematics-computer science! <br>
            Right now, I'm looking for full-time software engineering roles for after my graduation. Like many others, 
            my passion for computer science started from an interest in video games. <br> Nowadays, I'm just intrigued by the complexity
        and creativity that lies within computer science.
