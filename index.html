        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Andy Liu, a senior at UC San Diego. I study mathematics-computer science! 
            Right now, I'm looking for full-time software engineering roles for after my graduation. Like many others, 
            my passion for computer science started from an interest in video games. Nowadays, I'm just intrigued by the complexity
        and creativity that lies within computer science.</p>
