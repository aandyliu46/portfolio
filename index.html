                <p>I'm Andy Liu, a senior at UC San Diego studying Mathematics-Computer Science! <br>
                    I've had the chance to explore my passion for computer science through my various classes and internships. <br>
                    I've gained skills in both full-stack and embedded systems work, but am not limited to only that. I'm a fast and eager learner! &#129299;<br>
                    Right now, I'm looking for full-time software engineering roles for after my graduation. <br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights, playing games, cooking, and spending quality time with friends and family! &#x1F600;<br>

                I grew up in Oakland, CA to immigrant Chinese parents. I have 3 sisters, and 2 half sisters! 
                Although I'm very familiar with how technologies work nowadays, this was not always the case for me. I used to be afraid 
                of messing around with the inner workings of a computer, always scared I would break something. I was also scared of not 
                knowing what I was doing. I hated that feeling and wanted to conquer it. I started taking computer science classes, and while that 
                feeling is still there sometimes, I've learned to embrace it. Whenever I get that feeling, its a sign that I have to dig 
                deeper into what I'm learning. Like Jeff Bezos famously said, stress is caused by inaction.
